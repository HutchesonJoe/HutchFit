#HutchFit

HutchFit is an application for a personal trainer to log new clients information and keep track of their roster. It accesses information from a local JSON file, creates a summary for a new client based on information entered into a form, displays a roster of current clients, and provides a summary of each client's current fitness journey. 

##functionality

Currently, the application gives a personal trainer two options from the Home Page:
  1. Enter a new client. Takes in:
    a. client name
    b. client age
    c. client height
    d. client weight
    e. challenges/injuries/issues
    f. days per week
    g. will work out on their own
    h. equiptment  
  2. Create a client roster. Fetches information from a JSON file and populates a roster list. Clicking on a client's name in the roster list provides a brief summary of the client based on the information above. 

 
While this application is currently very basic, in the future, the application could be build out to incorporate movements into a client's repertoire, program workouts, and track client progress.

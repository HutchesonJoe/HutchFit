HutchFit is an application for a personal trainer to track their clients', their clients' programming, and their clients' progress. 

Currently, the application gives a personal trainer three options from the Home Page (which provides a description of the app):
  1. Enter a new client. Takes in:
      a. client name
      b. client age
      c. client height
      d. client weight
      e. challenges/injuries/issues
      f. days per week
      g. will work out on their own
      h. equiptment
  2. create a client program
    Based on a Two sessions a week plan. 
    A list of current client "buttons" lead to a new page? Or opens a window on the current page? 
    once under the new client, the trainer creates a workout or a program to add to the client's plan.
    Trainer chooses workout "Blocks". The HutchFit method is the basic outline:
      a. movement prep (same for everyone)
      b. LOW/MED cardio block (6-10min) 
      c. Push/Squat block(5-8 exercises for each, can be checked off or assigned to the workout?)
      d. MED/HIGH cardio block (6-10min)
      e. PULL/HIP HINGES block(5-8 exercises for each, can be checked off or assigned to the workout?)
      f. MAX cardio block
      g. Core
      h. cool down
 

extras (future fuctionality): 
record a program and/or? progress? 
send waiver to client.
